# MeDLogApp
A simple medication tracking app built with React.
Instead of building common beginner apps like task managers or dashboards, 
this project focuses on accessibility, real-life usefulness and personal health management.

My goal is to build something valuable for myself first, while 
learning professional development practices and demonstrating concrete skills as a junior developer.

If MedLog can eventually help others in a similar situation, that would be the best achievement.
